# Encryption-Demo
Basic encryption demonstration


This program accepts a string from the keyboard.  It then converts the string character by character to its ASCII integer codes.  It then converts the integers to binary.  The bytes are then encrypted bit by bit and the cipher text printed.  The cipher text is then decrypted back to the original binary, converted back to integer codes, and then back to the original characters and the decrypted text is printed.
